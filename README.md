# kami
The perfect text editor--not. It's the Neovim configuration I use mainly for web development.

## Installation
On most Linux systems you can simply run ```install.sh``` by executing
```bash
./install.sh
```

Do not run the script (or any script) unless you understand what it does and you are sure that it does what you want it to do. Be sure also not to skip reading the outputs, as they contain information as to what you may do next.

## Usage
Execute
```bash
nvim
```

Before using kami, you are expected to be familiar with vim basic usage, which can be learned pretty quickly from [this article](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-vim-101-a-beginners-guide-to-vim). It might be useful to follow along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N93cTbtLCIM), which walks you through the conveniences of LazyVim; and to read the [LazyVim documentation](https://www.lazyvim.org/).
